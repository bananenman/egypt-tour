EgyTour Cookie Policy

This Cookie Policy explains how EgyTour uses cookies and similar technologies on its website and app.  By using our website or app, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy.

What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

How does EgyTour use cookies?

We use cookies to improve your experience on our website and app, including:

* Remembering your preferences and settings.
* Tracking your usage of our website and app to help us improve our services.
* Targeting advertising to you based on your interests.

Types of cookies we use:

* Essential cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.  They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.  You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.
* Performance cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.  All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
* Functionality cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.  If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
* Targeting cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.  If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Managing your cookie preferences:

Most browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences. You can usually find information about how to do this in your browser's help section.  Please note that blocking all cookies may impact your ability to use certain features of our website and app.
